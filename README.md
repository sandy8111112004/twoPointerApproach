# Two Pointer Approach
Take "Container with Most Water" for example.
Given left pointer and right pointer.
When we consider which pointers to move toward centre, move the shorter height one because in that case we will have chance to get bigger quantity tank.

Two Pointer Approach Time Complexity: O(n).
Two Pointer Approach Memory Complexity: O(1).

Brute Force Time Complexity: O(n^2).
Brute Force Memory Complexity: O(1).
